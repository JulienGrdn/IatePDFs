# I ate PDFs

Got a bloated PDF? A messy stack of documents? **Feed them to this app.**

"I ate PDFs" is a simple, modern, and lightweight utility for the Linux desktop that devours your PDF files to make them more manageable. Built with Python and GTK4/Adwaita, it provides a clean and hungry drag-and-drop interface for all its functions.

## What it Eats

This app has a simple diet. It feasts on your documents to perform three core tasks:

*   **It compresses them:** Feeds on large, bloated PDFs and spits out lean, lightweight versions ideal for sharing.
*   **It merges them:** Consumes a whole stack of separate PDF files and digests them into a single, organized document.
*   **It rearranges their insides:** Chews up a PDF and lets you reorder its pages with a simple and satisfying drag-and-drop grid.

## The Philosophy

Why "I ate PDFs"? Because dealing with PDFs can be a chore. This tool isn't a complex, multi-course meal of features. It's the one that gets the job done quickly and without fuss. No complicated settings, no confusing menusâ€”just a window that's ready to eat whatever you throw at it.

## Technical Ingredients

*   **Python 3**
*   **GTK4 & Adwaita (libadwaita)** for a modern, native user interface
*   **PyPDF** for core PDF manipulation (merging, reordering)
*   **pdf2image** (with a Poppler dependency) for generating tasty page previews
*   **Ghostscript** for powerful PDF compression
